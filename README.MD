The Odin Project: Google Homepage
From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this project I will be recreating the Google Homepage. During this process I will be learning
key concepts of HTML and CSS. Including how to position items on a page and apply proper styling 
techniques.

HTML & CSS I used:

	-Structured page with Header, Nav, Section, and footer elements.
	-Positioned page items using margin, padding, and floats.
	-Top and Bottom Navs are made up of Lists.
	-Learned some form stying.

I still see things that could use improving, but the mission of this project was to create a look a like. Not to be a perfectionist and nail down every single feature 100%. So by sticking to that goal, I am happy with the outcome.
