The Odin Project: Google Homepage
From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this project I will be recreating the Google Homepage. During this process I will be learning
key concepts of HTML and CSS. Including how to position items on a page and apply proper styling 
techniques.
